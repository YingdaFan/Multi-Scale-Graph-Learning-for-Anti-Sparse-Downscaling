To train the SpatioTemporal model by low-resolution DRB dataset, run coarse.py

To train the SpatioTemporal model by high-resolution DRB dataset, run base.py

To use the basic downscaling method, run msgl.py

All of the spatiotemporal models are in the multiscale.MODEL with reference. All of the models are kept the same with
their original github verison, but the code is slight for the first layer and final layer of the forward function. 

The input of DRB Stream temperature data is [batch_size(number of nodes), sequence_length(number of days), number of features(7)].
